# CubeWizard: The 3D Cube Simulator

## Overview
Rubik's Revolution is an advanced 3D Rubik's Cube simulator that provides an interactive and comprehensive platform for both Rubik's Cube enthusiasts and algorithm developers. It combines manual manipulation of the cube with automated solving algorithms, making it a versatile tool for exploring and solving Rubik's Cubes.

## Features
- **3D Cube Visualization:** Real-time, interactive 3D representation of a Rubik's Cube.
- **Manual Cube Control:** Allows users to manually rotate and manipulate the cube.
- **Automated Solving Algorithms:** Includes beginner's method and Old Pochmann method for automated cube solving.
- **SFML Integration:** Uses the Simple and Fast Multimedia Library for rendering and user interaction.
- **Algorithm Speed Control:** Users can adjust the speed of the algorithm's execution.
- **Scramble Functionality:** Instantly scrambles the cube to start a new puzzle.
