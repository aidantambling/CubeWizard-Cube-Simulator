# CubeWizard: Simulated Rubik's Cube

## Overview

CubeWizard is a sophisticated 3D Rubik's Cube simulator which provides an interactive and comprehensive platform for Rubik's Cube manipulation. It combines manual manipulation of the cube with automated solving algorithms, making it a versatile tool for both exploring and solving Rubik's Cubes.

The Rubik's Cube is simulated as a 3D array with a network of interlinked pointers relating the tiles. This sophisticated structure of relationships allows the program to orient the tiles (through rotation) and ultimately solve the cube itself. Alternatively, the user can use input commands to scramble or solve the cube themselves.

## Features
- **3D Cube Visualization:** Real-time, interactive 3D representation of a Rubik's Cube built using the Simple and Fast Multimedia Library (SFML) framework.
- **Manual Cube Control:** Allows users to manually rotate and manipulate the cube.
- **Automated Solving Algorithms:** Includes beginner's method and Old Pochmann method for automated cube solving.
- **Algorithm Speed Control:** Users can adjust the speed of the algorithm's execution.
- **Scramble Functionality:** Instantly scrambles the cube to start a new puzzle.

## Installation
Before you start, make sure you have SFML installed on your system. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```console
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/Rubiks-Revolution-3D-Cube-Simulator.git
cd Rubiks-Revolution-3D-Cube-Simulator
```

Next, compile the included .cpp and .h files, then run main.cpp. An interactive window will be launched which allows for manipulation of a displayed cube.
